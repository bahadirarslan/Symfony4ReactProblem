# Symfony4ReactProblem
I am trying to run simple React code on Symfony 4 project but i couldn't achieve for days.
In my opinion i stuck because of a very tiny mistake but i can not see what it is.

In this simple project, i followed following tutorials
https://www.thinktocode.com/2018/06/21/symfony-4-and-reactjs/
https://symfony.com/doc/current/setup.html

But as you can see it is not working and i couldn't solve.
